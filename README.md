# EnderchestCommand
Simple plugin to access the contents of a players' enderchest. Supports other players' enderchests too!


Use /enderchest to access your own enderchest.

Use /enderchest <playername> to access the contents of another players' enderchest.
  

The implementation of permissions is a quick-and-dirty solution so it might work but might not do so aswell.
